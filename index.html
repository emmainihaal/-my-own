                My name is E.Nihaal, i am of 8th class, and i loved to play games. A day my father told that are you intrested in creating
                games? then i told i am intrested in creating games. then my father told that there is one website called WhiteHatjr. in which 
                we can create games . then he told that are you intrested to take the course of coding . then I told that I am . then he booked
                an trial class . in the trail class i was very nervous , when mam telling that this games are create by some students i was very 
                suprised , but there is technicl problem in that class. on that class the chrome is totally strucked , thats why the mam called
                RM and booked another trial class for me. in that class i am not at all nervous . on that class for me a telugu mam came she told 
                every thing and i was very intrested. then i told to my father that to book the course, and i told him to book 72classes . but 
                he booked only 48 classes and he told that if you perform well i will book more classes . then my first class booked and i was 
                very exited . and the teacher name is pravalika and she is from hyderabad . and my first class done very well and i was very happy.
                But the mam took only four class for me and she resigned . then the next class were took by shruthi mam of mumbai and she also
                told me very well . But the mam told that i am not doing the projects properly and i am very disapointed . and the shruthi mam took
                i think 5 to 21 class and she also resigned for it. and from the 22 to 51 class shruthiveeraraju and she is from karnataka . 
                and she took very well classes for me . and if i didnt did any work means she will give another chance . after that i will do my work.
                and now i am able to create some small small game.
                                                           
                                                             thank you.
